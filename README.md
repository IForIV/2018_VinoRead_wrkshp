# Runoff modeling: as simple as possible, but not simpler. Hydrological modeling workshop.

## Lecture and programming workshop

Author: Georgy Ayzel, PhD-student, the University of Potsdam, ayzel@uni-potsdam.de

The main idea of the presented lecture and programming workshop titled " *Runoff modeling: as simple as possible, but not simpler* " is to establish a baseline solution for runoff predictions for any basin around the globe using only an open data and models.
